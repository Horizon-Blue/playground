#Solutions to Exercises from _C++ Primer_, 5th Edition.

After thinking for a while, I finally decide to add my own solutions to the exercises in the fifth edition of _C++ Primer_ into this repo.

I didn't add those codes in the past (although I have been working on this book for quite a while) because I am not confident about my own
work. I am afraid that some people might googling into this repo and take these guesswork as some sample solutions. As a beginner, my
knowledge of the programming language is very limited, and my solutions to the exercises might be hopelessly wrong.

The codes I put here definately have nothing to do with "standard solutions," no... These are just something I write for practices (and
for fun). They are very personal. Sometime I won't even follow the direction, but do something in my own way. I put them here mostly as
notes for my study, but it is also great if you find the codes helpful.
